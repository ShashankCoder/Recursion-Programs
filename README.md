# Recursion [C and Java]

Notes:

[1]. printf("%d ",strcmp(string1, string2)) does not work.

[2]. Declaring a pointer to the string (char* str_ptr) and then sending it to another function just like we do with ordinary strings (char str[20]) does not give the correct results if the function (to which we are passing it to) parameters are also pointers to the string.
